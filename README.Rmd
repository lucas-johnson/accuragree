# agreeable

The goal of agreeable is to provide a set of simple tools to assess agreement 
between two matching datasets. The specific use case under which this package was 
developed is to assess the agreement between modeled and observed datasets.

Computations following [Ji and Gallo 2006](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asprs/pers/2006/00000072/00000007/art00006).


## Examples
Here are some of the basic tools made available by agreeable... 

### Simulated data generation:
```{r datagen, results = 'asis', warning=F}
library(agreeable)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)

set.seed(123)
observed <- sort(rnorm(500, mean = 300, sd = 75))
predicted_systematic <- sort(rnorm(500, mean = 275, sd = 100))

sds <- c(1, 5, 10, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150)
predicted_unsystematic <- sort(rnorm(500, mean = 300, sd = sds))
```

### 1. AC 
Compute AC (agreement coefficient), ACs (systematic agreement), ACu 
(unsystematic agreement), PUD (percentage of unsystematic difference), and PSD 
(percentage of systematic difference):

Systematic differences dominate:
```{r example_1_systematic, results = 'asis', warning=F}
knitr::kable(
    data.table::data.table(
        AC = ac(observed, predicted_systematic),
        ACs = acs(observed, predicted_systematic),
        ACu = acu(observed, predicted_systematic),
        PUD = pud(observed, predicted_systematic),
        PSD = psd(observed, predicted_systematic)
    )
)
```

Unsystematic (random) differences dominate:
```{r example_1_unsystematic, results = 'asis', warning=F}
knitr::kable(
    data.table::data.table(
        AC = ac(observed, predicted_unsystematic),
        ACs = acs(observed, predicted_unsystematic),
        ACu = acu(observed, predicted_unsystematic),
        PUD = pud(observed, predicted_unsystematic),
        PSD = psd(observed, predicted_unsystematic)
    )
)
```


### 2. GMFR 
Scatter plot with 1:1 and Geometric Mean Functional Relationship (GMFR) lines:

Systematic differences dominate:
```{r example_2_systematic, results = 'asis', warning = F}

# Intercept
a <- a_gmfr(observed, predicted_systematic)

# Slope
b <- b_gmfr(observed, predicted_systematic)

ggplot2::ggplot(data = NULL) + 
    ggplot2::geom_point(
        aes(x = observed, y = predicted_systematic), 
        alpha = 0.7, 
        color = "black"
    ) + 
    ggplot2::geom_abline(aes(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "black")) + 
    ggplot2::geom_abline(aes(slope = b, intercept = a, color = "orange")) + 
    ggplot2::scale_color_identity(
        labels=c("1:1", "GMFR"), 
        guide="legend", 
        name = ""
    )
```

Unsystematic (random) differences dominate:
```{r example_2_unsystematic, results = 'asis', warning = F}

a <- a_gmfr(observed, predicted_unsystematic)

# Slope
b <- b_gmfr(observed, predicted_unsystematic)

ggplot2::ggplot(data = NULL) + 
    ggplot2::geom_point(
        aes(x = observed, y = predicted_unsystematic), 
        alpha = 0.7, 
        color = "black"
    ) + 
    ggplot2::geom_abline(aes(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "black")) + 
    ggplot2::geom_abline(aes(slope = b, intercept = a, color = "orange")) + 
    ggplot2::scale_color_identity(
        labels=c("1:1", "GMFR"), 
        guide="legend", 
        name = ""
    )
```
